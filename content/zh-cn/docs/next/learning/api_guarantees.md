description: KV API guarantees made by etcd
---
etcd是具有[mini-transaction][txn]支持的一致且持久的key value存储。
etcd is a consistent and durable key value store with [mini-transaction][txn] support. 
这个key value存储通过KV APIs来暴露的。etcd试图为分布式系统提供了最强的一致性和持久性保证。
The key value store is exposed through the KV APIs. etcd tries to ensure the strongest consistency and durability guarantees for a distributed system. 
本规范列举了etcd所做的KV API保证。
This specification enumerates the KV API guarantees made by etcd.

### APIs to consider

* Read APIs
    * range
    * watch
* Write APIs
    * put
    * delete
* Combination (read-modify-write) APIs
    * txn
* Lease APIs
    * grant
    * revoke
    * put (attaching a lease to a key)

### etcd specific definitions etcd 具体的定义

#### Operation completed 操作完成

当通过consensus提交后，etcd的操作被认为完成了， 如此“executed” -- 永久的存储 -- 通过etcd存储引擎。 
客户端认为当从etcd server接收响应时那操作就完成了。
An etcd operation is considered complete when it is committed through consensus, and therefore “executed” -- permanently stored -- by the etcd storage engine. The client knows an operation is completed when it receives a response from the etcd server.
注意如果超时或者在客户端和etcd成员之间有网络中断，也许客户端不确定一个操作的状态。
 Note that the client may be uncertain about the status of an operation if it times out, or there is a network disruption between the client and the etcd member.
 当有领导选举时，etcd可能也会终止operations。在此事件中，etcd不会在有未完成的请求时向客户端发送`abort`响应。
  etcd may also abort operations when there is a leader election. etcd does not send `abort` responses to  clients’ outstanding requests in this event.

#### Revision

这是etcd的一个操作，当修改了key value存储时，这个操作会分配一个单独的自增revision。
An etcd operation that modifies the key value store is assigned a single increasing revision. 
一个事物操作也许会修改key-value好多次，但是只有一个revision被指定。
A transaction operation might modify the key value store multiple times, but only one revision is assigned. 
看不懂这一句
The revision attribute of a key value pair that was modified by the operation has the same value as the revision of the operation.

这个修订版本可以用作键值存储的逻辑时钟。
 The revision can be used as a logical clock for key value store.
 
 一个较小revision的键值对被修改之后有一个更大的revision。
  A key value pair that has a larger revision is modified after a key value pair with a smaller revision. 
  
  具有相同的revision的两个键值对由一个操作“并发地”修改。
  Two key value pairs that have the same revision are modified by an operation "concurrently".

### Guarantees provided 提供的保证

#### Atomicity 原子性

所有的API要求是原子的； 一个操作要么完成，要么不完成。
All API requests are atomic; an operation either completes entirely or not at all. 
对于watch请求，一个操作生成的所有的事件将在一个watch中响应。Watch不会监控一个操作的部分事件。
For watch requests, all events generated by one operation will be in one watch response. Watch never observes partial events for a single operation.

#### Durability 持久化

任何完成的操作都是持久的。所有的访问数据也是持久数据。读取从来不会返回没有持久化的数据。
Any completed operations are durable. All accessible data is also durable data. A read will never return data that has not been made durable.

#### Isolation level and consistency of replicas 副本的隔离级别和一致性

etcd ensures [strict serializability][strict_serializability], which is the strongest isolation guarantee of distributed transactional database systems. Read operations will never observe any intermediate data.

etcd ensures [linearizability][linearizability] as consistency of replicas basically. As described below, exceptions are watch operations and read operations which explicitly specifies serializable option.

From the perspective of client, linearizability provides useful properties which make reasoning easily. This is a clean description quoted from [the original paper][linearizability]: `Linearizability provides the illusion that each operation applied by concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response.`

For example, consider a client completing a write at time point 1 (*t1*). A client issuing a read at *t2* (for *t2* > *t1*) should receive a value at least as recent as the previous write, completed at *t1*. However, the read might actually complete only by *t3*. Linearizability guarantees the read returns the most current value. Without linearizability guarantee, the returned value, current at *t2* when the read began, might be "stale" by *t3* because a concurrent write might happen between *t2* and *t3*.

etcd does not ensure linearizability for watch operations. Users are expected to verify the revision of watch responses to ensure correct ordering.

etcd ensures linearizability for all other operations by default. Linearizability comes with a cost, however, because linearized requests must go through the Raft consensus process. To obtain lower latencies and higher throughput for read requests, clients can configure a request’s consistency mode to `serializable`, which may access stale data with respect to quorum, but removes the performance penalty of linearized accesses' reliance on live consensus.


### Granting, attaching and revoking leases

etcd provides [a lease mechanism][lease]. The primary use case of a lease is implementing distributed coordination mechanisms like distributed locks. The lease mechanism itself is simple: a lease can be created with the grant API, attached to a key with the put API, revoked with the revoke API, and will be expired by the wall clock time to live (TTL). However, users need to be aware about [the important properties of the APIs and usage][why] for implementing correct distributed coordination mechanisms.
